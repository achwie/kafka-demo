# About

This is a simplified demo shop using microservices in practice. It uses the [Hystrix library](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) from Netflix to be more resilient. It's a copy of the [Hystrix Demo project](http://github.com/achwie/hystrix-demo) but with the aim to be a more complete microservices application (e.g. using an API gateway).
